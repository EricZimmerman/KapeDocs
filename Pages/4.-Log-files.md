# Log files

As KAPE operates, it generates several log files in different locations. This section will discuss those logs and what they contain.

When KAPE starts, the current date and time are recorded. This value is used in naming the log files. The format for the timestamp is `yyyy-MM-ddTHH_mm_ss_fffffff` and will be reflected in each of the log files discussed below. This allows you to group the log files up across multiple runs of KAPE.

## Console log

The console log contains everything that was displayed in the command window while KAPE is running. A high-resolution timestamp along with the message level and message is displayed. This is the primary log that serves to preserve the actions KAPE took while operating. The `--debug` and `--trace` switches affect the level of detail that ends up in this log. This log will end up in `--tdest` and/or `--mdest` unless an error happens. In that case, it is written to the same directory where `kape.exe` is located.

## Copylog and Skiplog

KAPE generates a detailed files related to both file copies and file skips. The file names contain the timestamp mentioned above, along with the value of `--target` that was provided on the command line.  If there were multiple Targets supplied on the command line, the Target names are replaced with "(Multiple)"

For example, if `--target` EvidenceOfExecution were used, the following logs would be created:

* `2018-09-03T14_51_21_7565737_EvidenceOfExecution_copylog.csv`
* `2018-09-03T14_51_21_7565737_EvidenceOfExecution_skiplog.csv`

## *_copylog.csv

This file contains the details of the various files copied from `-–tsource`, in comma-separated value (CSV) format. This is useful for loading into Timeline Explorer, Excel, Modern CSV, or similar. 

Details include:

* `CopiedTimestamp`: The date and time when the file copy operation was logged
* `SourceFile`: Full path to source file. In the case of files originating from VSCs, this will reflect an originating directory of `VSS` followed by the VSC # and path where the file was found
* `DestinationFile`: Full path to the destination file. This will have a base directory of `--tdest`, along with the drive letter or VSC name where the file was found
* `FileSize`: The size of the file, in bytes
* `SourceFileSha1`: The SHA-1 value of the source file
* `DeferredCopy`: If true, the file was locked and subsequently read via a raw disk read
* `CreatedOnUtc`: File created timestamp
* `ModifiedOnUtc`: File modified timestamp
* `LastAccessedOnUtc`: File last accessed timestamp
* `CopyDuration`: How long the file copy operation took. Format is `hours:minutes:seconds.fffffff`

## *_skiplog.csv

This file contains the details of the various files NOT copied from `--tsource`. This can be due to deduplication, or SHA-1 exclusion via the `--hex` switch

Details include:

* `SourceFile`: Full path to source file. In the case of files originating from VSCs, this will reflect an originating directory of `VSS` followed by the VSC # and path where the file was found
* `SourceFileSha1`: The SHA-1 value of the source file
* `Reason`: Why the file was skipped (either "Excluded" or "Deduped")
